        <h2>Graduate Self Employment</h2>
    <p>
      Overall, the future of graduate self-employment looks bright,<br>
       with more and more graduates exploring this option as a way <br>
        to achieve greater flexibility and financial independence. <br>
         As the economy continues to evolve, <br>
          self-employment is likely to become an even more <br>
           viable career path for graduates <br>
            in a wide range of fields.

      <h2>Graduate Self Employment</h2>
      <p>
        However, it's worth noting that self-employment also <br>
         comes with its own set of challenges. Self-employed individuals <br>
          are responsible for finding their own clients, <br>
           managing their own finances, and handling all aspects of their business. <br>
            This can be daunting for some graduates, <br>
             particularly those who don't have <br>
              much experience in these areas.
